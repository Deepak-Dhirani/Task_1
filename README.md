# GitHub Connect

GitHub Connect is a Django web application that allows users to connect to their GitHub account and fetch their public and private repositories. The application uses the PyGithub library to interact with the GitHub API.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the application, you'll need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Python (version 3.6 or later)
- Django (version 3.2 or later)
- PyGithub library

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-connect.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd github-connect
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required Python packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Create a new GitHub App by following these steps:
   - Go to your GitHub account settings
   - Navigate to Developer Settings
   - Create a new GitHub App
   - Configure the app with the necessary permissions (e.g., `repo` scope)
   - Generate and save the client ID and client secret

6. In the `github_connect/settings.py` file, update the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` variables with your GitHub App's credentials.

7. Run the Django migrations to create the database tables:

   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

8. Start the development server:

   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

9. Open your web browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to access the application.

## Authorization Access Token

For authorization and authentication with the GitHub API, this project uses an access token. To obtain an access token, follow the instructions provided in the [PyGithub issue #1719](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/1719#issuecomment-748853997).

Once you have the access token, update the `github_connect` view in the `github_app/views.py` file with the appropriate code to use the access token for authentication.
